## Motivation
Neuroscience gives me a new perspective about myself. The true reason why I began studying and obsessing over neuroscience is because I really want to understand myself - a.k.a why does electrical signals can be converted to who I am (because most often times, what we think about determines who we are, and it is really hard to detach that. I am not saying that it is impossible to change who we are, but it's another topic).

## How external modality be converted into information?

Let us begin by observing how external modalities (such as light) be converted to information by reading this flow:
